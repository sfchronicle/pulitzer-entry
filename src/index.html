          <p>Some disasters happen in a moment, or unfold over a few hours. They may be confined to one place. Their cause mays be obvious. The fires that swept through Northern California's Wine Country fit none of those descriptions. They were so big they touched eight counties, so powerful they created tornadoes that flipped cars as they wiped out whole neighborhoods. They were effectively breaking news for weeks.</p>
          <p>The following is a summary of how The San Francisco Chronicle responded when more than a dozen wildfires kicked off during a windstorm in the middle of the night of Oct. 8 and 9. The fires would become the most destructive in state history, killing 44 people and destroying 8,900 structures.</p>

Numerous wildfires have ignited in Sonoma, Napa and Mendocino counties north of San Francisco and are spreading fast. Such fires are common in California in the summer and fall, but these are different — they're being pushed by winds topping 70 mph, and thousands of people are running for their lives. Bulwa uses social media and phone calls to collect facts as well as early photographs from witnesses while mobilizing the newsroom. As he writes, one of the biggest fires, the Partrick Fire, ignites west of Napa at 11:48 p.m. The Chronicle posts his first story at 12:06 a.m., still hours before the worst destruction hits Sonoma County.

Among them:<br><br><div class='block'>– Joaquin Palomino and Kimberly Veklerov used California’s public records law to report a <a href='//www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Wine-Country-requested-hundreds-of-engines-in-12368349.php' target='_blank'>startling story</a>: Commanders overseeing two of the biggest fires requested 305 fire engines through the state’s mutual-aid program, but only 130 engines were sent over the first 12 hours. Officials in Mendocino County requested 15 engines from outside agencies, but none was sent the first day. The story prompted California lawmakers to call a joint <a href='//www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Lawmakers-to-investigate-response-to-Wine-Country-12372868.php' target='_blank'>legislative hearing</a> on the mutual aid system.<br>– Reporter Evan Sernoffsky and photographer Michael Macor became the only journalists to go to the origin points of the four largest fires. <a href='//www.sfchronicle.com/news/article/where-the-blazes-began-12294729.php' target='_blank'>Their findings</a>: Power lines ran near each, and at two locations, downed electric and telecommunications lines were surrounded by crime-scene tape. The cause of the fires is under investigation, but utility Pacific Gas and Electric Co. has <a href='//www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/PG-E-suspends-dividends-over-possible-wildfire-12445592.php' target='_blank'>suspended its dividend</a> on the expectation it will be found liable.<br>– David Baker revealed that the night the fires began, PG&E <a href='//www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Power-line-restart-device-implicated-in-past-12324764.php' target='_blank'>failed to shut down</a> electrical devices that have sparked previous wildfires. The devices send pulses of electricity through a line that appears to have failed, in hopes of restarting it. If a line has fallen, however, those pulses can start fires. California’s other two major utilities shut off the devices during fire weather, <a href='//www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Power-line-restart-device-implicated-in-past-12324764.php' target='_blank'>Baker found</a>, but PG&E left most of its on when winds tore through the Wine Country.</div>"
