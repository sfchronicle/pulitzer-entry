          <p>Some disasters happen in a moment, or unfold over a few hours. They may be confined to one place. Their cause mays be obvious. The fires that swept through Northern California’s Wine Country fit none of those descriptions. They were so big they touched eight counties, so powerful they created tornadoes that flipped cars as they wiped out whole neighborhoods. They were effectively breaking news for weeks.</p>
          <p>The following is a summary of how The San Francisco Chronicle responded when more than a dozen wildfires kicked off during a windstorm in the middle of the night of Oct. 8 and 9. The fires would become the most destructive in state history, killing 44 people and destroying 8,900 structures.</p>

Such fires are common in California in the summer and fall, but these are different — they’re being pushed by winds topping 70 mph, and thousands of people are running for their lives.
