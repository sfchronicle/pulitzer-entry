          <p>Some disasters happen in a moment, or unfold over a few hours. They may be confined to one place. Their cause mays be obvious. The fires that swept through Northern California’s Wine Country fit none of those descriptions. They were so big they touched eight counties, so powerful they created tornadoes that flipped cars as they wiped out whole neighborhoods. They were effectively breaking news for weeks.</p>
          <p>The following is a summary of how The San Francisco Chronicle responded when more than a dozen wildfires kicked off during a windstorm in the middle of the night of Oct. 8 and 9. The fires would become the most destructive in state history, killing 44 people and destroying 8,900 structures.</p>
          <p>Covering the firestorm was both difficult and important. Journalists worked long hours in sometimes dangerous conditions at a time when people were desperate for good information. In the first minutes, and then over many days and weeks, The Chronicle illuminated the disaster by providing the most timely, thorough and probing coverage on an array of platforms.</p>

This reporting has swift impact: California’s U.S. senators send a letter to the Federal Communications Commission urging upgrades in the Wireless Emergency Alert system. In November, the FCC acts, requiring wireless carriers to take steps to improve the system. Later, The Chronicle would report that 85 percent of the more targeted warning calls Sonoma County did make in the early hours of the fires went unanswered.
