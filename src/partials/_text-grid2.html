    			<div class="story-deck">After reporting shortly after the fires began that Sonoma County officials had decided not to send a mass wireless emergency alert that might have saved lives, The Chronicle <a href="//www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Alerts-reached-few-in-Sonoma-County-in-early-12477770.php" target="_blank"> follows up</a> with a report that shows that only 15 percent of warning calls the county did place to residents in the fires’ path were answered.

    			<div class="story-deck">Chronicle reporters examine the Hazard Mitigation Plan that Sonoma County emergency officials file with the federal government. It shows that the county had long been aware that a “catastrophic” wildfire could “overwhelm resources and cause significant damage.” The county had updated it just months before the fires struck, but many mitigating actions had not been taken.</div><div class='readmore'><a href='//www.sfchronicle.com/news/article/Sonoma-County-hazard-plan-foresaw-deadly-Wine-12310097.php' target='_blank'><div class='btn'>Read the story</div></a></div>

    			<div class="story-title">Mutual aid failure</div>
    			<div class="story-deck">Using public records requests, The Chronicle reports a startling story: Commanders overseeing two of the biggest fires requested 305 fire engines through the state’s mutual-aid program, but only 130 engines were sent in the first 12 hours. Officials in Mendocino County requested 15 engines, but none was sent the first day. The story prompted a joint <a href="//www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Lawmakers-to-investigate-response-to-Wine-Country-12372868.php" target="_blank"> legislative hearing</a> on the mutual aid system.</div><div class='readmore'><a href='//www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Wine-Country-requested-hundreds-of-engines-in-12368349.php' target='_blank'><div class='btn'>Read the story</div></a></div>

    			<div class="story-deck">Chronicle journalists go to the likely origin points of the four largest fires. They find that power lines had run near each, and at two locations, downed electric and telecommunications lines are surrounded by crime-scene tape. The cause of the fires remains under investigation, but utility Pacific Gas and Electric Co. has <a href="//www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/PG-E-suspends-dividends-over-possible-wildfire-12445592.php" target="_blank"> suspended its dividend</a> on the expectation it will be found liable.</div><div class='readmore'><a href='//www.sfchronicle.com/news/article/where-the-blazes-began-12294729.php' target='_blank'><div class='btn'>Read the story</div></a></div>

    			<div class="story-deck">On the night the fires began, The Chronicle finds, PG&E failed to shut down devices that had sparked previous wildfires by sending  pulses of electricity through lines that appear to have failed. California’s other two major utilities shut off the devices during fire weather, but PG&E left most of its on when high winds tore through Wine Country. The utility has since <a href="//www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/PG-E-may-shut-off-power-lines-to-prevent-fires-in-12434759.php" target="_blank"> changed its policy</a> on the devices.</div><div class='readmore'><a href='//www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Power-line-restart-device-implicated-in-past-12324764.php' target='_blank'><div class='btn'>Read the story</div></a></div>

    			<div class="story-deck">The Chronicle reports that state regulators had begun developing stricter fire safety regulations for electric utility companies after power lines caused a massive wildfire in 2007, but had never completed them. The regulations <a href="//www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/California-adopts-sweeping-new-fire-safety-rules-12431121.php" target="_blank"> would only be enacted</a> several weeks after the Wine Country fires charred 245,000 acres, destroyed nearly 9,000 structures and killed 45 people.</div><div class='readmore'><a href='//www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Why-tougher-fire-safety-rules-for-utility-12370180.php' target='_blank'><div class='btn'>Read the story</div></a></div>
